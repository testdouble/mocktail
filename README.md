# Mocktail

Mocktail is a mocking library for Ruby built with modern Ruby 3 APIs and the
_only one_ with first-class support for type checking with
[Sorbet](https://sorbet.org). Mocktail was created to accelerate test-driven
development in Ruby and is designed to prevent common problems that lead to
brittle and confusing tests.

Your first choice is a consequential one: **how do you want your Mocktail?**
